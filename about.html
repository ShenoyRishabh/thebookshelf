    Welcome to the official website of 'The Bookshelf' based in "Adithya Serene Apartment"
    <br>Yes! We do have our own library in our apartment.
    <br> Where you can buy, sell, and rent books!
    <br>But guess what? It's owned by kids! Yes, completely owned by us kids.
    <br>And this is me, Rishabh Shenoy (from C002), the owner of this library. I run it along with Arush V.S (from C302), my friend.
